# SP_SC_Hardened_Website

Hardened website for the Secure Coding (SC) module in SP.

We were given code for a website and tasked to perform certain hardening methods. The vulnerabilities discovered were based on the OWASP Top 10: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/ 

Vulnerabilities Patched:
- SQL Injections
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Broken Access Control
- Cryptographic Failures

Note that there may be more vulnerabilties in the website, but the patches deployed were sufficient for the requirements of the assignment.
